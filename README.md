# IDSS-PortQualityAndRouteCalculatorV2
Project prototype for DV2573 - Decision Support Systems. 
This system exists to support shippers in decision making by supplying plenty of data from the World Port Index on around 3.7k different ports and terminals.

Written in ASP.NET MVC while using Javascript, and the Openlayers library, for map visualization. The Branch and Bound algorithm is written in C# while a Python script is used to borrow distances between ports from sea-distances.org.
